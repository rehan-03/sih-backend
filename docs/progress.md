## Blockers log
| Date | Blocker | Notes | Resolved? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-28 | Blockchain Explorer Data Source Audit | Verified that Phase 3 GET /trace uses 100% real live keyless public APIs: BTC uses Blockstream Esplora (blockstream.info/api) & Mempool.space; ETH uses Blockscout v2 REST API (eth.blockscout.com/api/v2). Neither is mocked. Tested and confirmed against live mainnet transactions. Optional Etherscan/Alchemy API keys can be added for higher rate limits. | Yes (Verified Keyless Live) |
| 2026-08-28 | Phase 6 LLM Hardware Feasibility | Host machine has NVIDIA RTX 2050 (4 GB VRAM) and 12 GB RAM (~2.5 GB free). Llama-3-8B (needs 5.5–6 GB VRAM) cannot fit in 4 GB GPU VRAM alone and is slow/tight on CPU. Ollama is installed at C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Programs\Ollama. Recommended architecture: Use lightweight 3B local models (Llama-3.2-3B or Qwen2.5-3B) which fit 100% in 4 GB VRAM, with deterministic spaCy / regex fallback for air-gapped low-spec execution. | Documented / Solved via 3B/spaCy fallback |
| 2026-08-29 | Phases 0–5 Codebase Dynamic Audit | All endpoints (/correlate, /check-wallet, /trace, /risk, /cases/{id}/report) verified dynamic against live Postgres, Redis, Neo4j, Blockstream/Blockscout APIs, and trained XGBoost/SHAP. Found minor Phase 0 leftovers: hardcoded dev credentials in auth.py (line 47), obsolete Phase 0 stub files (risk_model.py, rules.py, clustering.py), and cold-start fallback import name in model.py (line 27). | Documented / Pending cleanup |
